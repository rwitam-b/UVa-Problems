# UVa-Problems
This is a collection of the UVa Online Judge problems that are solved by me. I started solving them as a means to sharpen my skills for competitive programming.

My other objective was to get a grip of C++, mainly for competitive coding purposes, as I was mainly a JAVA guy.

This repo is just a means to document my journey throughout. Please feel free to check out any of the codes you want. But please do not blindly copy them as that just doesn't help anybody :P
